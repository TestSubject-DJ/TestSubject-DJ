### 🧪 About Me — The QA Bit

I'm a Manual QA specialist with a passion for quality, usability, and smooth user experiences. Whether it's exploratory testing, test case design, or regression hunting, I bring a methodical mindset and a sharp eye for detail. I love working closely with devs, product teams, and fellow QAs to make sure bugs don’t stand a chance.

- 🐞 Experienced in cross-platform testing (web/mobile)
- 📋 Skilled in writing and maintaining clear, reusable test cases
- 🧠 Curious mindset — always asking "what if?"
- 🤝 Team player who thrives on collaboration

Currently leveling up my automation skills with **TypeScript + Playwright** 🚀

### 🎶 After Hours — The Music Bit

When I'm not chasing bugs, I’m in the booth or studio spinning and producing **underground house music**. You can find my tracks on [https://open.spotify.com/artist/6HaKvR8UvKwViIaIpUPVJA](url), and some of them even charted on [https://www.beatport.com/artist/gino-colombi/1033866](url)

Music fuels my creativity, keeps me grounded, and sometimes inspires test names that slap. 🎧
